# WebDecode

This challenge is a simple website with no real content. Inspecting the page source didn't turn up anything for the index or contact page; however, on the about page there was a `notify_true` property on a `section` tag which contained a base64 encoded string which was suspect. Decoding that with `base64.b64decode()` returned the flag.
