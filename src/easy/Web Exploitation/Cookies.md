# Cookies

This cookie search challenge asks you to type the name of cookies into a search bar which then says if it's a cookie or not. Inspecting the actual cookies of the page shows a value gets returned for each cookie. I assumed we had to find the cookie with the highest value which wasn't true in the end. After searching for additional cookies manually, it dawned on me we can change the value of the cookie on the `/check` page and resend the request. Doing so a few times, eventually with a certain number, returned the flag instead of if the cookie was valid or not. I was about to create a script to iterate 1-100 for me but came upon the flag before needing to do that.
